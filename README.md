NEURAL: A Neonatal EEG Feature Set in Matlab 
============================================

Matlab code to generate a set of quantitative features from multichannel EEG
recordings. Features include amplitude measures, spectral measures, and basic connectivity
measures (across hemisphere's only). Also, for preterm EEG (assuming gestational age < 32
weeks), will generate features from bursts annotations (e.g. maximum inter-burst
interval). Burst annotations require a separate package, also available on
[github](https://github.com/otoolej/burst_detector).
